# Quick Intro to Scala

This is a 30 minute tutorial I gave to
[our NLP research group](http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/) who wanted to get a taste
of Scala.

It uses [tut](https://github.com/tpolecat/tut) to compile the examples and
include output in the generated markdown.

Just run `sbt tut` and look for `target/scala-2.11/tut/Tutorial.md`.
